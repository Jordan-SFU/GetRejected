Our frontend was built with React and CSS, while our backend was built in Python with the Django REST framework. 

We used the Google Chrome Webkit Speech Recognition for our speech-to-text transcription. Resume information was scraped with the OCR API and LinkedIn profiles were scraped with Selenium. AI analysis tools were based off of OpenAi's GPT-4o-mini model.
